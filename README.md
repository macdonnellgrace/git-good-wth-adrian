# git-wth-adrian
This repository is used to practice git commands and github workflows for the Git Good with Adrian workshop.

# Practice Instructions
## Setup
1. Install git on your machine
2. Configure git with your name and email
    - `git config --global user.name "<your_name>"`
    - `git config --global user.email "<your_email>"`
    - Do not use your student email!
3. Create a github account (again do not use your student email)

## Part 1: Setup
1. Fork this repository to your github account
2. On local machine, create a directory `C:\users\<yourname>\dev\`
3. Navigate to the directory `C:\users\<yourname>\dev\`
4. Clone this repository to your local machine in current directory
5. Pull latest changes from upstream remote repository
    - If there is no upstream remote repository, add it with the following command
      - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/AdrianCapacite/git-good-wth-adrian.git`
    - Pull latest changes from upstream remote repository
      - `git pull upstream master`

## Part 2: Make your changes
1. Create a new branch with your name
2. Edit the git_masters.json file
    - Follow the format of my entry in students
        - Name
        - Your perferred language
3. Add the file to the staging area
4. Commit the file to the local repository
5. Merge changes into the main branch
6. Push changes to the remote repository

## Part 3: Dealing with merge conflicts
Sometimes merge conflics happen and you have to resolve them.
1. Merge the branch `joe` into the main branch
    - Git will tell you that there is a merge conflict
2. Open the file with the merge conflict, You will see the following
    - ```
        <<<<<<< HEAD
        Your changes
        =======
        Joe's changes
        >>>>>>> joe
        ```
    - The between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` are the changes in the current (main) branch
    - The between `=======` and `>>>>>>> joe` are the changes in the joe branch
3. Delete joe's changes and keep your changes by deleting between `=======` and `>>>>>>> joe`
4. Then delete the lines `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======` and `>>>>>>> joe`
5. Commit the changes
6. Push changes to the remote repository

## Part 3: Create a pull request
1. Log into github
2. Navigate to the upstream remote repository
3. Create a pull request
4. Wait for approval
